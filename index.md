### About Me
> Hello Folks! I'm [**Arjun Krishna**](http://arjunkrishna.in/). I'm a Post Graduation Student in Computer Applications (MCA) from [**Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technology**](http://www.kristujyoticollege.com), Changanacherry. I have been exploring the world of IoT since my graduation life started. My life around IoT started to change when I got unrestricted access to the Mini IoT Lab that we setup at our [**Inovus Labs IEDC**](https://inovus-labs.web.app/). Happy to say, I'd almost tried out around 95% of components at the lab. I'm here to learn more on IoT; and thus awaiting for the future Levels of **Kerala IoT Challenge**.
